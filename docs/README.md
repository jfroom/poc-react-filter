# Challenge project - Post Filters

Create a React or Backbone app that implements client-side post filtering. The post filtering UI/code should be scalable and well structured, so that it's easy to show a subset of filters, and add new filters.

To participate, please fork this repo, and send us a link to repo and working demo (eg on github pages would be welcome). We expect this project to take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours, please limit yourself to AT MOST 3 hours!

## Current UIs

We have two UIs that provide post filtering in our app now:

1. Viewer user interface [View video](https://www.useloom.com/share/2c3ec7456f3b443f992605a5c2adffc6)
2. Moderation user interface [View video](https://www.useloom.com/share/0aa58a1ea2e54d8989a1b2930e90524b)

You are not constrained to either style.

## Sample data

`sample.html` provides a sampling of posts.

`sample.json` provides the data in JSON form. Feel free to extend the schema. 

## What we're checking

Maintainable code (naming, comments, code structure, modularity), pleasant UX.

## Questions to consider

How could we extend this system to work with an API instead of filtering on the client? What decisions went in to your choice of UI for filters?

## Final thoughts

The exercise is meant to be open ended in terms of specs as it mimics our how we build features day-to-day: We want our developers to take ownership of the features they build and we want them to be responsible for the specs of the features they build based on customer input. 

Just to reiterate, not every part of the project needs to be polished, however, we are hoping to be impressed in at least one component of the project. It's not a screening challenge like at other companies, but a challenge that gives you a chance to show us what you're capable of. It is a very important data point that allows us to feel confident in bringing a candidate onto our team.
